I'm David (he/him), a software engineer in the MSVC / C++ team at Microsoft, working on the [Address Sanitizer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/sanitizers/asan?view=msvc-170). I was previously working on [Durable Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-overview?tabs=in-process%2Cnodejs-v3%2Cv1-model&pivots=csharp), a serverless durable execution framework, but I've moved to the "open source ranks" of the project.

I enjoy working on dev tools and keeping up with the latest research on programming languages theory; I'm a big nerd for that sort of stuff. The shared logical foundations between database and programming languages theory are also of particular interest to me, so I try to keep one foot in both the systems world and another in PL. In the past, I completed a BS and MS at UC San Diego, where I was advised by Nadia Polikarpova and Arun Kumar on a few research projects.
